# DSC180A-genome-data-pipeline

Pipeline includes: downloading data, zipping files, converting FASTQ to SAM, SAM to BAM, Getting dictionary of reference genome, and BAM to VCF.
Analysis Process involving: filtering Chromosomes 19-22, compressing files, Merging VCF's, running PCA, and plotting.
Code should take ~30 minutes to run. Reduced PCA to only being run with 4 Chromosomes but notebook contains code involving 22 chromosomes.
